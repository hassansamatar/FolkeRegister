Norwegian national identity number
The Norwegian national identity number is an 11-digit personal identifier. Everyone on the Norwegian National Registry has a national identity number.

Have you just had a child?
The Tax Administration issues the child with a national identity number once the hospital has sent a notification of birth to the Tax Administration.

Norwegian citizens born or resident abroad who need a national identity number in order to be issued with a Norwegian passport
Structure of the national identity number
The national identity number consists of 11 digits
The first six digits represent the date of birth in the order date, month, year
The next three digits are an individual number, the third digit of which indicates gender – even numbers for women and odd numbers for men
The last two digits are control digits
The last five digits of the national identity number constitute the personal number
The three digits comprising the individual number are allocated sequentially within the specific date of birth. Individual digits are allocated as follows:
born 1854-1899: allocated from series 749-500
born 1900-1999: allocated from series 499-000
born 1940-1999: also allocated from series 999-900
born 2000-2039: allocated from series 999-500
Example
Day	Month	Year	Individual number	Control digits
01	12	99	551	31
 

The first digits in the individual number show that the person was born in the 1800s and the last digit indicates a man. This number would belong to a man born on 1 December 1899. For reasons of data privacy, this is not an actual national identity number.
